# Started from the bottom now I'm here

- My wireframe: Started out as one thig ended up being something completly different. Was going for a photo caption app but found an advice api so went with the advice app.

- Biggest challenge was finding something different and actually fun to do! No api was working the way I wanted it too so I have to mix 2 together. 

- Got everything finally working! I wanted a smoke effect on some letters but the letters never returned.

- I don't know why I can't get it to look exactly how I have it in my head! But its complete!
